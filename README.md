This repository contains all the design and analysis tools and documentation around Dev's implementation of the glass frog rocket.

# The Glass Frog

Concept: Design and fly a fully generatively designed rocket where the organic fluid design of the rocket is emphasized.

To be able to do this, the concept and loads must be analysed. To house all the derivations and the detailed design concepts, this repository has been created.

I will try to maintain logs, past design results etc.
The analysis that I do to figure out the loads can be used as a guide to do similar analyses on similar scale rockets, and possibly adapted to larger rockets.

The core read-able documentation is created using latex, and the pdfs in this repository might be quite useful to the reader.
